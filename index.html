            <small>Author: Travellar Sajib</small>
            <p>Last year i went on a Sylhet tour with my friends. If i had gone to Sylhet before. But this trip was very
                enjoyable one. On this trip we went to Bichanakandi and Ratarghul in Sylhet. The places were very nice.
                We
                turned around and took pictures. We enjoyed tyhe beauty of nature. It's good to say it was raining that
                day.
                It
                was a trip we had to remember. At the end of day, we left for home.</p>
